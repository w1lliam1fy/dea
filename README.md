## Moderation
DEA has the most detailed and efficient moderation system across all Discord Bots. On top of features such as automatic unmutes and custom set moderator roles, there are moderation logs, to keep up with everything your mods are doing. 

Furthermore, if were wanted to have a trace of all changes made to your server that weren't done via the bot, such as manual bans or role modifications, detailed logs are for you.

Keep in mind these features are fully optional, and will not in anyway affect the functionality of the bot if they are not set.
## DEA Cash System
One of the best ways to keep an engaging and active community running. This bot encourages chatting and helps form relationships between other users, bonding communities closer together.

The subtle references to the Nacro's show and many jokes slipped in here and there across the bots commands provides loads of amusement amongst groups. 
## Setup

In order to run the bot, you must create a Credentials.json file, following the same format as the Credentials Example.json file. This will by default be gitignored, to prevent any accidental commits of your token.

Furthermore, a connection to either a local or hosted MongoDB database is required as the large majority of the commands depends on the database storage. The connection string format is displayed in the Credentials Example.json file.

## Contributing

All forms of contributions are highly appreciated. Anywhere from posting a git issue suggesting a new feature all the way to reworking the database models, ANY type of help will be accepted.
